// THE screen registry: every screen × fixture the QA gate shoots and checks. A screen PR adds its screens here; the
// suite then covers them at every size and theme on Linux and macOS, and any finding fails the PR.
//
// To register a screen (routes and ids: F1's route table, src/renderer/screens/shell/routes.ts):
//   1. The screen's root carries data-screen="<id>", or "<id>.<state>" for a sub-state such as "board.empty"; the
//      harness waits for either.
//   2. Add an entry below: the id, the hash route that shows it, and the fixtures it must survive: the stress
//      fixtures that touch its data (long-text, many-*), plus empty and the error states it renders.
//   3. A screen with no route of its own gets `open`, using keys, roles and labels rather than CSS classes:
//        { id: "palette", route: "#/", fixtures: ["typical"], open: (page) => page.keyboard.press("ControlOrMeta+K") }
//        { id: "inbox", route: "#/board?inbox", fixtures: ["needs-you", "long-text", "empty"] }
// Fixtures are E3b's, built by `pnpm fixtures` into app/desktop/fixtures/<name>.json.
